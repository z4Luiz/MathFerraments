## Features

1. **Unit Conversion:**
   - Convert values between different units of measurement (e.g., length, mass, volume).
   - Select the input and output units to perform the conversion.

2. **Quadratic Equation Solver:**
   - Solve quadratic equations by entering the coefficients (A, B, C).
   - View the roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation.

3. **Geometry Calculator:**
   - Calculate the area, perimeter, and diagonal of geometric shapes (e.g., triangle, square).
   - Input the required parameters and receive instant calculations.

## Getting Started

### Running the App

To run the app, simply hit the "Run" button on your chosen development environment. The project includes necessary configurations for Replit, ensuring a seamless setup.

### Running Commands

Execute commands using `bundle exec` to run them in the context of the installed gems environment. The console pane provides server output, and you can run additional commands from the shell without stopping the server.

### Database

While SQLite is suitable for development, consider exploring the built-in [Replit database](http://docs.replit.com/misc/database) or connecting to databases from your preferred provider for production use.

### Securing Your App

Follow the steps outlined in the [Securing Your App](#securing-your-app) section of the template README to enhance the security of your Rails application.

## Usage

### Unit Conversion

1. Enter a numerical value in the input field.
2. Choose the unit of measurement for the input value.
3. Select the desired unit for the conversion.
4. Click the "Convert" button to view the converted result.

### Quadratic Equation Solver

1. Input the coefficients (A, B, C) of the quadratic equation.
2. Click the "Calculate Roots" button.
3. View the roots (solutions) of the quadratic equation.

### Geometry Calculator

1. Choose a geometric shape (e.g., triangle, square).
2. Enter the required parameters (base, height, side, etc.).
3. Click the "Calculate" button to view area, perimeter, and diagonal calculations.
